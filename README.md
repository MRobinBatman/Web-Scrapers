# Web-Scrapers
This is a repository for some of the various types of web-scrapers I have written for the purpose of data collection for various projects.

## PS4DealsScraper
This is a beautifulsoup4 scraper that goes to a website to scrape current sale prices of Ps4 games as well as their normal prices. It saves that data into a dataframe, from which you can produce a '.csv' file, and it also logs the data to a mysql database.
